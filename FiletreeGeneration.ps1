.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a directory structure from a FILETREE file, using the script's location as the root.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script reads a text file named FILETREE that outlines a directory structure.
    It assumes the script is located in the project's root directory. The first line of
    the FILETREE file is expected to be the root directory's name and is ignored.
    The script then creates all subsequent files and folders relative to its own location.

    *** ENCODING NOTE ***
    To prevent character encoding issues in PowerShell, it's best to save this .ps1 file
    with "UTF-8 with BOM" encoding if your editor supports it. This version has been
    modified to be robust against these issues.

.USAGE
    1. Place this script inside your project's root folder (e.g., inside 'gemini-orchestrator/').
    2. Create a file named `FILETREE` (with no extension) in the same directory.
    3. Ensure the first line of FILETREE is the name of the root folder.
    4. Run the script from the PowerShell terminal: .\Create-FileTree.ps1
